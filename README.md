# Who's that Pokemon?

A web application for Pokemon enthusiasts who want to re-experience the classic, “Who’s that Pokemon?”. <br />
Project inspiration came from my love for Pokemon ever since I was little. I use to binge watch the shows play the games, aside from spin-offs. So, my goal was to incorporate "Who's that Pokemon?", in a replayable quiz game format and make it a learning experience by letting you see your match history and having the ability to view each pokemon in a pokedex. <br />
